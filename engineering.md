I am a software engineer at Google working on Android Toolkit. My primary focus on the team is [AndroidX Libraries](hhttps://developer.android.com/jetpack). You can see my public patches in [AOSP androidx project](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/).

Before joining Android I spent 3 years working on [Chrome for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome). My changes to Chromium are [publicly available](https://codereview.chromium.org/user/aurimas@chromium.org) to anyone interested. I mostly worked on front-end features of Chrome, but I was also interested in keeping code clean and Chrome for Android as small as possible.

Over my time as a programmer and a geek I worked with a number of languages (Java, Python, C++, PHP, etc.). I think that every language has its own designated purpose, but currently I am a big fan of Python.
