		<p>Aurimas Liutikas - software engineer by day and headshot/portrait photographer on weekends.</p>
		<p>I was born in Lithuania. I spent most of my life living in a small town called Kuliai.
For 11 years I studied in a public Lithuanian school, and then moved to Norway to
study in Red Cross Nordic United World College to earn International Baccalaureate
diploma. Later, I studied Computer Science and Engineering at Bucknell
University and graduated in May 2012.</p>
